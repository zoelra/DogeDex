# DogeDex
Image processing machine for classifying dog breeds
The purpose of this repo is to track the progress of my app idea DogeDex.

DogeDex will be an image classification application for phones. It will allow the user to take a photo of a /
/ dog and then the machine will classify the breed and display the results to the user.
The starting point for the neural network is the MNIST project "go-to" code to obtain above a 99% accuracy for classification.
To see my original code for MNIST, please review my repo for CE4708.

I plan to take the base code and adapt it to fit the purposes of my idea.
If anyone has any suggestions please let me know! This is my first non-school based project and I am excited to get started.
